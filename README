This program is meant to benchmark NVIDIA's CUDA API. To invoke the program,
type './benchmark <iteration count> <input file>' where '<iteration count>'
is the number of times to run each benchmark and '<input file>' is a path 
to file to benchmark. It may be necessary to add the shared object library
'libccc.so.*' to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' variable. In order to do this, type
'env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:./' as a prefix to the program
invocation command. Please note that this program is for benchmarking
purposes only and should not be used on unique data or in an attempt to 
secure data.

As this program makes use of the CUDA API, it will be necessary to have a
CUDA-capable device installed on the host computer. It will also be necessary
to be running the appropriate graphics driver and have any necessary
environment variables set up. These tasks are beyond the scope of this
README file; please refer to NVIDIA's website for help getting CUDA setup
on your machine.

This program was implemented as part of Oregon State University's Computer
Science Capstone Project (also referred to as "Senior Design"). The final
write-up for this project may be found under 'doc/final_report.pdf'.
